# My-Safari-Knowledge-Quiz

Animals can entertain people in so many ways. We got the zoo to see them, we read about them on the internet or books to learn more about them. Now would you say you know your animals? Safari Knowledge Quiz is created to test how well children, under the age of 5, know their animals. This game hopes to entertain children when they want to know more about their animals.
